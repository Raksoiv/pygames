# First Pygame Tutorial

In this game I am following the turorial from [realpython: pygame a primer](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/#sprite-images) in which an airplane struggles to avoid obstacles.

For the game i use this image package: https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-redux

And finally added some custom touches:

- Score counter and summary score screen
